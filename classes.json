Working in small groups, students improvise scenes which are then analyzed and developed with Kevin\u2019s guidance (and comedic commentary). He walks the class through turning raw improv into a structured sketch\u2014building characters, heightening the comedy, and shaping a narrative. Each scene is then performed again as a refined sketch. By the end of the intensive, students will create their own improvised scenes and begin transforming them into original sketches. It\u2019s a fun, fast-paced crash course in writing without the blank page. This workshop includes a 1 hour lunch break. </blockquote><h3 id=\"\">About Kevin McDonald</h3><blockquote id=\"\">Comedian, actor, writer and director Kevin McDonald founded \u201cThe Kids in the Hall\u201d with friend Dave Foley, after they met in Toronto at Second City, and the television series ran from 1988-1995.
